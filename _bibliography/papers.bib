abstract = {Network Functions (NFs) now touch a significant fraction of Internet traffic. The hope has been that software-based NF Virtualization (NFV) would enable rapid development of new NFs by vendors and leverage the power and economics of commodity computing infrastructure for NF deployment. To date, no cloud NFV systems achieve NF chaining, isolation, SLO-adherence, and scaling together with existing cloud computing infrastructure and abstractions, all while achieving generality, speed, and ease of deployment; these properties are taken for granted in other cloud contexts but unavailable for NF processing. We present Quadrant, an efficient and secure cloud-deployable NFV system, and show that Quadrant’s approach of adapting existing cloud infrastructure to support packet processing can achieve NF chaining, isolation, generality, and performance in NFV. Quadrant reuses common cloud infrastructure such as Kubernetes, cloud functions, the Linux kernel, NIC hardware, and switches. It enables easy NFV deployment while delivering up to double the performance per core compared to the state of the art.},

While finding optimal oblivious routing is intractable for general topologies, we show that it is tractable for structured topologies often used in datacenter networks. To achieve this, we apply graph automorphism and prove the existence of the optimal automorphism-invariant solution. This result reduces the search space to targeting the optimal automorphism-invariant solution. We design an iterative algorithm to obtain such a solution by alternating between two linear programs. The first program finds an automorphism-invariant solution based on representative variables and constraints, making the problem tractable. The second program generates adversarial demands to ensure the final result satisfies all possible demands. Since, the construction of the representative variables and constraints are combinatorial problems, we design polynomial-time algorithms for the construction. We evaluate proposed iterative algorithm in terms of throughput performance, scalability, and generality over three potential applications. The algorithm i) improves the throughput up to 87.5% over a heuristic algorithm for partially deployed FatTree, ii) scales for FatClique with a thousand switches, iii) is applicable to a general structured topology with non-uniform link capacity and server distribution.},

booktitle = {19th USENIX Symposium on Networked Systems Design and Implementation (NSDI 22)},
abstract = {In their quest to provide customers with good tools to manage cloud services, cloud providers are hampered by having very little visibility into cloud service functionality; a provider often only knows where VMs of a service are placed, how the virtual networks are configured, how VMs are provisioned, and how VMs communicate with each other. In this paper, we show that, using the VM-to-VM traffic matrix, we can unearth the functional structure of a cloud service and use it to aid cloud service management. Leveraging the observation that cloud services use well-known design patterns for scaling (e.g., replication, communication locality), we show that clustering the VM-to-VM traffic matrix yields the functional structure of the cloud service. Our clustering algorithm, CloudCluster, must overcome challenges imposed by scale (cloud services contain tens of thousands of VMs) and must be robust to orders-of-magnitude variability in traffic volume and measurement noise. To do this, CloudCluster uses a novel combination of feature scaling, dimensionality reduction, and hierarchical clustering to achieve clustering with over 92% homogeneity and completeness. We show that CloudCluster can be used to explore opportunities to reduce cost for customers, identify anomalous traffic and potential misconfigurations.},

abstract = {Public outdoor surveillance cameras often have limited metadata describing their properties. Frequently, a public camera’s precise position, orientation, focal length, and image center are unknown; these attributes are necessary to precisely pinpoint the location of events seen in the camera. In this article, we ask: what is the minimal information needed to accurately estimate these properties for public cameras? We show, using a judicious combination of projective geometry, neural networks, and crowd-sourced annotations from human workers, that it is possible to, for example, localize 95% of the cameras in our test data set to within 12&nbsp;m using a single image taken from the camera. This performance is an order of magnitude better than PoseNet, a state-of-the-art neural network that needs significantly more information than our approach, and can only estimate position and orientation (and not other properties). Finally, we show that the camera’s inferred pose and properties can help design a number of virtual sensors, all of which have good accuracy.},

abstract = {Autonomous vehicles use 3D sensors for perception. Cooperative perception enables vehicles to share sensor readings with each other to improve safety. Prior work in cooperative perception scales poorly even with infrastructure support. AUTOCAST1 enables scalable infrastructure-less cooperative perception using direct vehicle-to-vehicle communication. It carefully determines which objects to share based on positional relationships between traffic participants, and the time evolution of their trajectories. It coordinates vehicles and optimally schedules transmissions in a distributed fashion. Extensive evaluation results under different scenarios show that, unlike competing approaches, AUTOCAST can avoid crashes and near-misses which occur frequently without cooperative perception, its performance scales gracefully in dense traffic scenarios providing 2-4x visibility into safety critical objects compared to existing cooperative perception schemes, its transmission schedules can be completed on the real radio testbed, and its scheduling algorithm is near-optimal with negligible computation overhead.},

abstract = {While most networks have long lifetimes, temporary network infrastructure is often useful for special events, pop-up retail,
or disaster response. An instant IoT network is one that is rapidly constructed, used for a few days, then dismantled. We consider the
synthesis of instant IoT networks in urban settings. This synthesis problem must satisfy complex and competing constraints: sensor
coverage, line-of-sight visibility, and network connectivity. The central challenge in our synthesis problem is quickly scaling to large
regions while producing cost-effective solutions. We explore two qualitatively different representations of the synthesis problems using
satisfiability modulo convex optimization (SMC), and mixed-integer linear programming (MILP). The former is more expressive, for our
problem, than the latter, but is less well-suited for solving optimization problems like ours. We show how to express our network
synthesis in these frameworks. To scale to problem sizes beyond what these frameworks are capable of, we develop a hierarchical
synthesis technique that independently synthesizes networks in sub-regions of the deployment area, then combines these. We find
that, while MILP outperforms SMC in some settings for smaller problem sizes, the fact that SMC’s expressivity matches our problem
ensures that it uniformly generates better quality solutions at larger problem sizes.},

                  developing an IoT for the battlefield? This paper describes
                  unique challenges in such a context as well as potential
                  risks, mitigation strategies, and benefits.},

    ABSTRACT = { The popularity of mobile apps continues to grow as developers take advantage of the sensors and data available on mobile devices. However, the increasedfunctionality comes with a higher energy cost, which can cause a problem for users on battery constrained mobile devices. To improve the energy consumption of mobile apps, developers need detailed information about the energy consumption of their applications. Existing techniques have drawbacks that limit their usefulness or provide information at too high of a level of granularity, such as components or methods. Our approach is able to calculate source line level energy consumption information. It does this by combining hardware-based power measurements with program analysis and statistical modeling. Our empirical evaluation of the approach shows that it is fast and accurate. },

While previous approaches have advocated placing rules either on hypervisors or switches, we argue that future data centers would benefit from leveraging rule processing capabilities at both for better scalability and performance. In this paper, we propose vCRIB, a virtualized Cloud Rule Information Base that allows operators to freely define different management policies without the need to consider underlying resource constraints. The challenge in our approach is the design of a vCRIB manager that automatically partitions and places rules at both hypervisors and switches to achieve a good trade-off between resource usage and performance. },

Unlike previous workon wireless sensing, crowd-sensing poses several novel requirements:support for humans-in-the-loop to trigger sensingactions or review results, the need for incentives, as wellas privacy and security. In this paper, we design and implementMedusa, a novel programming framework for crowdsensing that satisfies these requirements. Medusa provideshigh-level abstractions for specifying the steps required tocomplete a crowd-sensing task, and employs a distributedruntime system that coordinates the execution of these tasksbetween smartphones and a cluster on the cloud. We haveimplemented ten crowd-sensing tasks on a prototype of Medusa.We find that Medusa task descriptions are two orders of magnitudesmaller than standalone systems required to implementthose crowd-sensing tasks, and the runtime has lowoverhead and is robust to dynamics and resource attacks. },

    ABSTRACT = { Increasingly, mobile devices equipped with 802.11n interfaces are being used for a wide variety of applications including bandwidth-intensive HD video streaming. Recent work has shown that 802.11n interfaces are power-hungry, so energy management is an important challenge. 802.11n implementations have additional power states relative to earlier generations of 802.11 technology, so energy management challenges for 802.11n are qualitatively different compared to that faced by prior work.In this paper, we describe the design and implementation of Snooze, an energy management technique for 802.11n which uses two novel and inter-dependent mechanisms: client micro-sleeps and antenna configuration management. In Snooze, the AP monitors traffic on the WLAN and directs client sleep times and durations as well as antenna configurations, without significantly affecting throughput or delay. Snooze achieves 30~ 85% energy-savings over CAM across workloads ranging from VoIP and video streaming to file downloads and chats. },

Wireless sensing and actuation have been explored in many contexts, but the
automotive setting has received relatively little attention. Automobiles have
tens of onboard sensors and expose several hundred engine parameters which can
be tuned (a form of actuation). The optimal tuning for a vehicle can depend
upon terrain, traffic, and road conditions, but the ability to tune a vehicle
has only been available to mechanics and enthusiasts. In this paper, we
describe the design and implementation of CarMA (Car Mobile Assistant), a
system that provides high-level abstractions for sensing automobile parameters
and tuning them. Using these abstractions, developers can easily write
smartphone ``apps'' to achieve fuel efficiency, responsiveness, or safety goals.
Users of CarMA can tune their vehicles at the granularity of individual trips,
a capability we call personalized tuning. We demonstrate through a variety of
applications written on top of CarMA that personalized tuning can result in
over 10% gains in fuel efficiency. We achieve this through route-specific or
driver-specific customizations. Furthermore, CarMA is capable of improving user
satisfaction by increasing responsiveness when necessary, and promoting
vehicular safety by appropriately limiting the range of performance available
to novice or unsafe drivers.},

With the advent of smartphone technology, it has
become possible to conceive of entirely new classes of applications.
Social swarming, in which users armed with smartphones
are directed by a central director to report on events in the
physical world, has several real-world applications. In this paper,
we focus on the following problem: how does the director optimize
the selection of reporters to deliver credible corroborating
information about an event? We first propose a model, based
on common intuitions of believability, about the credibility of
information. We then cast the problem as a discrete optimization
problem, and introduce optimal centralized solutions and an
approximate solution amenable to decentralized implementation
whose performance is about 20% off on average from the optimal
while being 3 orders of magnitude more computationally efficient.
More interesting, a time-averaged version of the problem is
amenable to a novel stochastic utility optimization formulation,
and can be solved optimally, while in some cases yielding
decentralized solutions.},

			Complex interference in static multi-hop wireless

			Since TCP does not explicitly account for this, starvation
			and unfairness can result from the use of TCP over such

			fair and efficient congestion control for multi-hop wireless mesh
			networks. First, we design an AIMD-based rate-control protocol
			called Wireless Control Protocol (WCP) which recognizes
			that wireless congestion is a neighborhood phenomenon, not
			a node-local one, and appropriately reacts to such congestion.
			Second, we design a distributed rate controller that estimates
			the available capacity within each neighborhood, and divides

			Resource constrained mobile devices need to leverage computation
			on nearby servers to run responsive applications that recognize
			objects, people, or gestures from real-time video. The two
			key questions that impact performance are what computation to offload,
			and how to structure the parallelism across the mobile device
			and server. To answer these questions, we develop and evaluate
			three interactive perceptual applications. We find that offloading
			and parallelism choices should be dynamic, even for a given application,
			as performance depends on scene complexity as well as environmental
			factors such as the network and device capabilities. To
			this end we develop Odessa, a novel, lightweight, runtime that automatically
			and adaptively makes offloading and parallelism decisions
			for mobile interactive perception applications. Our evaluation
			shows that the incremental greedy strategy of Odessa converges to
			an operating point that is close to an ideal offline partitioning. It
			provides more than a 3x improvement in application performance
			over partitioning suggested by domain experts. Odessa works well
			across a variety of execution environments, and is agile to changes
			in the network, device and application inputs.

			Many emerging location-aware applications require position information.
			However, these applications rarely use celltower-based localization
			because of its inaccuracy, preferring instead to use the
			more energy-hungry GPS.
			In this paper, we present CAPS, a Cell-ID Aided Positioning
			System. CAPS leverages near-continuous mobility and the position
			history of a user to achieve significantly better accuracy than
			the celltower-based approach, while keeping energy overhead low.
			CAPS is designed based on the insight that users exhibit consistency
			in routes traveled, and that cell-ID transition points that the
			user experiences can, on a frequently traveled route, uniquely identify
			position. To this end, CAPS uses a cell-ID sequence match-
			ing technique to estimate current position based on the history of
			cell-ID and GPS position sequences that match the current cell-ID
			sequence. We have implemented CAPS on Android-based smartphones
			and have extensively evaluated it at different locations, and
			for different platforms and carriers. Our evaluation results show
			that CAPS can save more than 90\% of the energy spent by the positioning
			system compared to the case where GPS is always used,
			while providing reasonably accurate position information with errors
			less than 20\% of the celltower-based scheme.

        In this paper, we explore a simple yet effective technique for

        starvation in a wireless mesh network is avoided. Our explicit
        allocation is efficient, redistributing unused airtime and
        also accounting for airtime rendered unusable by external

        and the 802.11 MAC, and is responsive to short flows,
        MAC-layer auto rate adaptation, and other dynamics, as we
        demonstrate in extensive experiments on two indoor testbeds.
        Despite its simplicity, the technique is on average within 12\%
        of the max-min optimal allocation on several topologies.

        Emerging high-rate applications (imaging, structural monitoring,
        acoustic localization) will need to transport large volumes of data
        concurrently from several sensors.  These applications are also
        loss-intolerant. A key requirement for such applications, then,
        is a protocol that reliably transport sensor data from many sources
        to one or more sinks without incurring congestion collapse.
        In this paper, we discuss RCRT, a rate-controlled reliable transport
        protocol suitable for constrained sensor nodes.
        RCRT uses end-to-end explicit loss recovery, but places all the
        congestion detection and rate adaptation functionality in the sinks.
        This has two important advantages: efficiency and flexibility.
        Because sinks make rate allocation decisions, they are able to
        achieve greater efficiency since they have a more comprehensive
        view of network behavior. For the same reason, it is possible to
        alter the rate allocation decisions (for example, from one that
        ensures that all nodes get the same rate, to one that ensures that
        nodes get rates in proportion to their demands), without modifying
        sensor code at all. We evaluate RCRT extensively on a 40-node wireless
        sensor network testbed and show that RCRT achieves 1.7 times the rate
        achieved by IFRC and 1.4 times that of WRCP, two recently proposed
        interference-aware distributed rate-control protocols.
        We also present results from a 3-month-long 19-node real world
        deployment of RCRT in an imaging application and show that RCRT works
        well in real long-term deployments.

        Many emerging smartphone applications require position information to
        provide location-based or context-aware services. In these
        applications, GPS is often preferred over its alternatives such as
        GSM/WiFi based positioning systems because it is known to be more
        accurate. However, GPS is extremely power hungry. Hence a common
        approach is to periodically duty-cycle GPS. However, GPS duty-cycling
        trades-off positioning accuracy for lower energy.  A key requirement
        for such applications, then, is a positioning system that provides
        accurate position information while spending minimal energy.

        In this paper, we present RAPS, rate-adaptive positioning system for
        smartphone applications. It is based on the observation that GPS is
        generally less accurate in urban areas, so it suffices to turn on GPS
        only as often as necessary to achieve this accuracy. RAPS uses a
        collection of techniques to cleverly determine when to turn on GPS.
        It uses the location-time history of the user to estimate user
        velocity and adaptively turn on GPS only if the estimated uncertainty
        in position exceeds the accuracy threshold. It also efficiently
        estimates user movement using a duty-cycled accelerometer, and
        utilizes Bluetooth communication to reduce position uncertainty among
        neighboring devices. Finally, it employs celltower-RSS blacklisting to
        detect GPS unavailability (e.g., indoors) and avoid turning on GPS in
        these cases. We evaluate RAPS through real-world experiments using a
        prototype implementation on a modern smartphone and show that it can
        increase phone lifetimes by more than a factor of 3.8 over an approach
        where GPS is always on.

        Many applications are enabled by the ability to capture videos on a
        smartphone and to have these videos uploaded to an Internet-connected
        server.
        This capability requires the transfer of large volumes of data from
        the phone to the infrastructure.
        Smartphones have multiple wireless interfaces~--~3G/EDGE and
        WiFi~--~for data transfer, but there is considerable variability in
        the availability and achievable data transfer rate for these networks.
        Moreover, the energy costs for transmitting a given amount of data on
        these wireless interfaces can differ by an order of magnitude.
        On the other hand, many of these applications are often naturally
        delay-tolerant, so that it is possible to delay data transfers until a
        lower-energy WiFi connection becomes available.
        In this paper, we present a principled approach for designing an
        optimal online algorithm for this \emph{energy-delay tradeoff} using the
        Lyapunov optimization framework.
        Our algorithm, called \salsa, can automatically adapt to channel
        conditions and requires only local information to decide whether and
        when to defer a transmission.
        We evaluate \salsa using real-world traces as well as
        experiments using a prototype implementation on a modern smartphone.
        Our results show that \salsa can be tuned to achieve a broad spectrum
        of energy-delay tradeoffs, is closer to an empirically-determined
        optimal than any of the alternatives we compare it to, and, can save
        10-40\% of battery capacity for some workloads.

        Various sensor network measurement studies have reported instances of
        transient faults in sensor readings. In this work, we seek to answer
        a simple question: How often are such faults observed in real
        deployments & quest; We focus on three types of transient faults,
        caused by faulty sensor readings that appear abnormal. To understand
        the prevalence of such faults, we first explore and characterize four
        qualitatively different classes of fault detection methods. Rule-based
        methods leverage domain knowledge to develop heuristic rules for
        detecting and identifying faults. Estimation methods predict <A1><B0>normal<A1><B1>
        sensor behavior by leveraging sensor correlations, flagging anomalous
        sensor readings as faults. Time-series-analysis-based methods start
        with an a priori model for sensor readings. A sensor measurement is
        compared against its predicted value computed using time series
        forecasting to determine if it is faulty. Learning-based methods infer
        a model for the <A1><B0>normal<A1><B1> sensor readings using training data, and then
        statistically detect and identify classes of faults.
        We find that these four classes of methods sit at different points on
        the accuracy/robustness spectrum. Rule-based methods can be highly
        accurate, but their accuracy depends critically on the choice of
        parameters. Learning methods can be cumbersome to train, but can
        accurately detect and classify faults. Estimation methods are accurate,
        but cannot classify faults. Time-series-analysis-based methods are more
        effective for detecting short duration faults than long duration ones,
        and incur more false positives than the other methods. We apply these
        techniques to four real-world sensor datasets and find that the
        prevalence of faults as well as their type varies with datasets.
        All four methods are qualitatively consistent in identifying sensor
        faults, lending credence to our observations. Our work is a first step
        towards automated online fault detection and classification.

        Most sensor network research and software design has been guided by an
        architectural principle that permits multi-node data fusion on
        small-form-factor, resource-poor nodes, or motes.
        While we were among the earliest promoters of this approach,
        through experience we found that this principle leads to fragile and
        unmanageable systems and explore an alternative.
        The Tenet architecture is motivated by the observation that future
        large-scale sensor network deployments will be tiered,
        consisting of motes in the lower tier and masters,
        relatively unconstrained 32-bit platform nodes, in the upper tier.
        Tenet constrains multi-node fusion to the master tier while allowing
        motes to process locally-generated sensor data.
        This simplifies application development and allows mote-tier software to be reused.
        Applications running on masters task motes
        by composing task descriptions from a novel tasklet library.
        Our Tenet implementation also contains a robust and scalable networking
        subsystem for disseminating tasks and reliably delivering responses.
        We show that a Tenet pursuit-evasion
        application exhibits performance comparable to a mote-native
        implementation while being considerably more compact.
        We also present two real-world deployments of Tenet system;
        structural vibration monitoring application at Vincent Thomas Bridge and
        imaging-based habitat monitoring application at James Reserve;
        and show that tiered architecture scales network capacity and
        allows reliable delivery of high rate data.

        Many threads packages have been proposed for programming wireless sensor
        platforms.  However, many sensor network operating systems still choose to
        provide an event-driven model, due to efficiency concerns. We present TOSThreads,
        a threads package for TinyOS that combines the ease of a threaded programming
        model with the efficiency of an event-based kernel. TOSThreads is backwards
        compatible with existing TinyOS code, supports an evolvable, thread-safe kernel
        API, and enables flexible application development through dynamic linking and
        loading. In TOSThreads, TinyOS code runs at a higher priority than application
        threads and all kernel operations are invoked only via message passing, never
        directly, ensuring thread-safety while enabling maximal concurrency.
        The TOSThreads package is non-invasive; it does not require any
        large-scale changes to existing TinyOS code.
        <br>
        We demonstrate that TOSThreads context switches and system calls introduce an
        overhead of less than 0.92\% and that dynamic linking and loading takes as
        little as 90 ms for a representative sensing application.  We compare different
        programming models built using TOSThreads, including standard C with blocking
        system calls and a reimplementation of Tenet.  Additionally, we demonstrate that
        TOSThreads is able to run computationally intensive tasks without adversely
        affecting the timing of critical OS services.

        practical pursuit-evasion games with networked robots, where a
        communication network provides sensing-at-a-distance as well as a
        communication backbone that enables tighter coordination between pursuers.
        We first develop, using the theory of zero-sum games, an algorithm that
        computes the minimal completion time strategy for
        pursuit-evasion when pursuers and evaders have same speed, and when
        all players make optimal decisions based on complete knowledge.
        Then, we extend this algorithm to when evader are significantly
        faster than pursuers.
        Unfortunately, these algorithms do not scale beyond a small number
        of robots. To overcome this problem, we design and implement a
        partition algorithm where pursuers capture evaders by decomposing
        the game into multiple multi-pursuer single-evader games. We show
        that the partition algorithm terminates, has bounded capture time,
        is robust, and is scalable in the number of robots. We then describe
        the design of a real-world mobile robot-based pursuit evasion game.
        We validate our algorithms by experiments in a moderate-scale testbed
        in a challenging office environment. Overall, our work illustrates an
        innovative interplay between robotics and communication.}

an increasing need for re-usable, dynamically taskable
software systems that support multiple concurrent
applications. In this paper, we consider the problem of
energy management in such systems, taking Tenet as a case
study. Our work considers energy management under three new
constraints: dynamic multi-hop routing and tasking, multiple
concurrent applications, and reliable end-to-end data
delivery. We present AEM, an energy management system that
satisfies these constraints. AEM statically analyzes and
infers the traffic profile for the application and
accordingly tunes the duty-cycling protocol to provide the
best trade-off in latency and data delivery performance.
Furthermore, unlike other duty-cycling protocols with
pre-computed or fixed transmission and reception time slots,
AEM uses elastic schedules that allows it to adapt to
dynamics while enabling bounded latency of event detection.
Our experiments show that AEM achieves 1-3% duty-cycles,
while allowing concurrent applications to transmit 100% of
the sensor data in a multi-hop 40-node network testbed.}

guided by an architectural principle that permits multi-node
data fusion on small-form-factor, resource-poor nodes, or
motes. We argue that this principle leads to fragile and unmanageable
systems and explore an alternative. The Tenet
architecture is motivated by the observation that future largescale
sensor network deployments will be tiered, consisting
of motes in the lower tier and masters, relatively unconstrained
32-bit platform nodes, in the upper tier. Masters
provide increased network capacity. Tenet constrains multinode
fusion to the master tier while allowing motes to process
locally-generated sensor data. This simples application
development and allows mote-tier software to be reused.
Applications running on masters task motes by composing
task descriptions from a novel tasklet library. Our Tenet implementation
also contains a robust and scalable networking
subsystem for disseminating tasks and reliably delivering
responses.We show that a Tenet pursuit-evasion application
exhibits performance comparable to a mote-native implementation
while being considerably more compact.  },

routing in wireless sensor networks. In one thread of research
on geographic routing, researchers have explored robust,

techniques have high overhead, researchers have
more recently pursued a thread in which they propose precomputation
of routing structures (e.g., hull trees and grids)
to achieve low-overhead geographic routing.
In this paper we introduce a third approach, LCR, that
does not involve any precomputation of distributed routing
structures, nor full a priori planarization. Instead, LCR removes
non-planarities lazily only when they interfere with
correct geographic routing. Lazy removal of link crossings
results in an order of magnitude or more lower overhead than
any previously proposed approach.},

missions involve increasingly large number of satellites and surface
rovers/sensors communicating for coordinated science operations or for
on-demand commanding and/or transfer of data. Current approaches that
use static routing cannot scale to large numbers of satellites
and spacecrafts of future missions. This requires a dynamic approach
that can discover networks and links as they become available and
intelligently use them for routing. Furthermore, most of the science
missions will be geared towards collecting data using various
sensors. Adoption of a data-centric communication mechanism can enable
in-network aggregation and processing which help make data forwarding
more efficient. In this paper, we briefly describe ASCoT, a routing
system for science missions of tomorrow, which a) leverages the
predictability of satellite trajectories to effect position-based
routing in the space backbone, and b) departs from traditional
address-centric communication and uses a data-centric architecture to
enable energy efficient and low latency operation in proximity
networks. Our simulation study using STK/OPNET shows that ASCoT
architecture is viable."

In this paper, we report on a systematic medium-scale (up to sixty nodes)

	An example %of such a range query is:

	Our analysis reveals that, under reasonable assumptions

	In detailed simulations, we show that in practice, the

implicit assumption of trust and altruism among P2P users.
This assumption might be true (or might not matter) when a P2P network
is still in its infancy and is relatively small in size.
But the assumption might break down with increase in the
size and diversity of the P2P network.
In this paper, we discuss issues in the
design of rating schemes for P2P systems.
In keeping with the design philosophy of many of these system,
we consider the design of distributed rating systems.
As a case study, we illustrate two different approaches to
a distributed rating system aimed at tackling the free-rider
problem in P2P networks.
A key challenge in designing such rating schemes is to make
them collusion-proof: we discuss our efforts in this direction."

of peer-to-peer routing infrastructures. They enable
scalable wide-area storage and retrieval of information,
and will support the rapid development of a wide variety of
Internet-scale applications ranging from naming systems and
file systems to application-layer multicast. DHT systems
essentially build an overlay network, but a path on the
overlay between any two nodes can be significantly
different from the unicast path between those two nodes on
the underlying network. As such, the lookup latency in
these systems can be quite high and can adversely impact
the performance of applications built on top of such
systems.

In this paper, we discuss a random sampling technique that
incrementally improves lookup latency in DHT systems. Our
sampling can be implemented using information gleaned from
lookups traversing the overlay network. For this reason, we
call our approach {\em lookup-parasitic random sampling} (LPRS).
LPRS is fast, incurs little network overhead, and requires
relatively few modifications to existing DHT systems.

For idealized versions of DHT systems like Chord, Tapestry
and Pastry, we analytically prove that LPRS can result in
lookup latencies proportional to the diameter of the
network, provided the underlying physical topology has a
power-law latency expansion. We then validate this analysis
by implementing LPRS in the Chord simulator. Our
simulations reveal that LPRS-Chord exhibits a qualitatively
better latency scaling behavior relative to unmodified
Chord.

Finally, we provide evidence which suggests that the
Internet router-level topology resembles power-law latency
expansion. This finding implies that LPRS has significant
practical applicability as a general latency reduction
technique for many DHT systems. This finding is also of
independent interest since it might inform the design of
latency-sensitive topology models for the Internet."

describe a new model called ARAM that defines the structure of routing
tables of any given size.  Unlike simpler empirical models that work
backwards from effects (e.g. current prefix length distributions),
ARAM approximately models the causes of table growth (allocation by
registries, assignment by ISPs, multihoming and load balancing).  We
show that ARAM models with high fidelity three abstract measures
(prefix distribution, prefix depth, and number of nodes in the tree)
of the shape of the prefix tree --- as validated against 20 snapshots
of backbone routing tables from 1997 to the present.  We then use ARAM
for evaluating the scalability of IP lookup schemes, and studying
the effects of multihoming and load balancing on their scaling behavior.
Our results indicate that algorithmic solutions based on multibit
tries will provide more
prefixes per chip than TCAMs (as table sizes scale toward a million)
unless TCAMs can be engineered to use 8 transistors per cell.
By contrast, many of today's SRAM based TCAMs use 12-16 transistors per cell."

low-power, wireless devices. Given their unattended nature, and their
potential applications in harsh environments, we need a monitoring
infrastructure that indicates system failures and resource depletion.
In this paper, we briefly describe an architecture for sensor network
monitoring, then focus on one aspect of this architecture: continuously
computing aggregates (sum, average, count) of network properties
(loss rates, energy-levels etc., packet counts).
Our contributions are two-fold. First, we propose a novel tree construction
algorithm that enables energy-efficient computation of some classes
of aggregates. Second, we show through actual implementation
and experiments that wireless
communication artifacts in even relatively benign environments can
significantly impact the computation of these aggregate properties.
In some cases, without careful attention to detail, the relative error

than consider searches over time series data, we consider searches
over semantically rich high-level events, and present the design,
analysis, and numerical simulations of a spatially distributed index
that provides for efficient index construction and range searches. The
scheme provides for a more balanced sharing of communication load
over index nodes by using
the governing property that the wider the spatial extent known to an

Advances in processor, memory and radio technology will enable small
and cheap nodes capable of sensing, communication and
computation. Networks of such nodes can coordinate to perform
distributed sensing of environmental phenomena. In this paper, we
explore the \emph{directed diffusion} paradigm for such
coordination. Directed diffusion is data-centric in that all
communication is for named data. All nodes in a directed
diffusion-based network are application-aware. This enables diffusion
to achieve energy savings by selecting empirically good paths and by
caching and processing data in-network (\emph{e.g.}, data aggregation). We
explore and evaluate the use of directed diffusion for a simple
remote-surveillance sensor network analytically and
experimentally. Our evaluation indicates that directed diffusion can
achieve significant energy savings and can outperform idealized
traditional schemes (\emph{e.g.}, omniscient multicast) under the
investigated scenarios.

Experience with wired networks has provides guidance about what level
of detail is appropriate for simulation-based protocol studies.
Wireless simulations raise many new questions about appropriate levels
of detail in simulation models for radio propagation and energy
consumption.  This paper describes the trade-offs associated with
adding detail to simulation models.  We evaluate the effects of detail
in five case studies of wireless simulations for protocol design.
Ultimately the researcher must judge what level of detail is required
for a given question, but we suggest two approaches to cope with
varying levels of detail.  When error is not correlated, networking
algorithms that are robust to a range of errors are often stressed in
similar ways by random error as by detailed models.  We also suggest
visualization techniques that can help pinpoint incorrect details and
manage detail overload.

In most distributed systems, naming of nodes for low-level
communication leverages topological location (such as node addresses)
and is independent of any application.  In this paper, we investigate
an emerging class of distributed systems where low-level communication
does not rely on network topological location.  Rather, low-level
communication is based on attributes that are \emph{external} to the
network topology and \emph{relevant} to the application.  When
combined with dense deployment of nodes, this kind of named data
enables \emph{in-network processing} for data aggregation,
collaborative signal processing, and similar problems.  These
approaches are essential for emerging applications such as sensor
networks where resources such as bandwidth and energy are limited.
This paper is the first description of the software architecture that
supports named data and in-network processing in an operational,
multi-application sensor-network.  We show that approaches such as
in-network aggregation and nested queries can significantly affect
network traffic.  In one experiment aggregation reduces traffic by up
to 42\% and nested queries reduce loss rates by 30\%.  Although
aggregation has been previously studied in simulation, this paper
demonstrates nested queries as another form of in-network processing,
presents the first evaluation of these approaches over an operational
testbed.

In-network data aggregation is essential for wireless sensor networks
where energy resources are limited. In a previously proposed data
dissemination scheme (\emph{directed diffusion with opportunistic
aggregation}), data is opportunistically aggregated at intermediate
nodes on a low-latency tree. In this paper, we explore and evaluate
\emph{greedy aggregation}, a novel approach that adjusts aggregation
points to increase the amount of path sharing, reducing energy
consumption. Our preliminary results suggest that, under investigated
scenarios, greedy aggregation can achieve up to 45\% energy savings
over opportunistic aggregation in high-density networks without
adversely impacting latency or robustness.
